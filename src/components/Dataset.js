        With the aim of increasing awareness and understanding for biodiversity
        issues, 22nd May is proclaimed as "The International Day for
        Biodiversity Diversity (IDB)" by the United Nations. Initially 29th
        December was the date attached with IDB, but in December 2000, the UN
        General Assembly adopted 22 May as IDB, to commemorate the adoption of
        the text of the Convention on 22 May 1992 by the Nairobi Final Act of
        the Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on
        Biological Diversity.

        <br />
        IDB has an unique theme for each year and likewise the theme for the
        year 2022 is "BUILDING A SHARED FUTURE FOR ALL LIFE". This year's theme
        is decided after taking into consideration the aim of highlighting the
        importance of biodiversity for many sustainable development issues. When
        we think about the lifestyle we are leading, the significance of this
        day comes into light as well. It is BIODIVERSITY that not only provides
        a home for many of the world's species, but also serves as a source of
        food, water, and other resources that we rely on to survive. Hence,
        understanding the value of biodiversity and acknowledging the problems
        associated with it is the need of the hour. Thus, this day is of utmost
        importance as well. <br />
        <br />
        To sum up, on this International Biodiversity Day, NITSMUN urges
        everyone to celebrate the biodiversity our Mother Nature embraces and
        work each day for giving all species their right to thrive on this
        planet.

This is especially important in this present age of globalisation with interconnected global economies and cultural exchanges. UN recognise the need to enhance the potential of culture as a means of achieving prosperity, sustainable development and global peaceful coexistence.",

        <br />
        Keeping these things in mind, the United Nations General Assembly
        declared this international holiday in 2002 following UNESCO's adoption
        of the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity in 2001 under UN
        Resolution 57/249. They recognise the need to “enhance the potential of
        culture as a means of achieving prosperity, sustainable development and
        global peaceful coexistence.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since then, this day has been celebrated all over the world to spread
        awareness about the need to bridge cultures for peace, stability and
        development. An interesting statistic to put this into perspective -
        over three fourths of world conflicts is due to lack of cultural
        harmony. The pandemic also proved the value and importance of the
        cultural and creative sector in generating social cohesion, educational
        resources and personal well-being in times of crisis. Cultural diversity
        contributes to both economic and personal development through exchange
        of ideas, intellectual values, emotions and morals, which makes it an
        indispensable part of sustainable development.
        <br />
        <br />
        Therefore, NITSMUN calls for the people of this world to come together
        and spread the essence of cultural diversity and hence, indirectly work
        towards making this world a better place to live in.

        The original roots of designating a day for Mother earth goes back to

        national political agendas. The UN Conference on the Human Environment
        1972 in Stockholm marked the beginning of global awareness of the
        interdependence among people, other living species and our planet, as
        well as the establishment of World Environment Day on 5 June and the UN
        Environment Programme. Heat waves, cyclones during the dry season- are some of the
        SOS calls we have come across in recent days.

        Heat waves, cyclones and floods during the dry season- are some of the
        SOS calls we have come across but have failed to meet the expectation at
        an institutional level. The past world leaders were reluctant enough to
        not take any coordinated and well-executed action despite having plans
        of sustainability against man’s never-ending demand of extracting
        natural resources. Now, we are running out of time, and climate change
        is triggering an irreversible chain reaction causing extreme weather
        events across the globe. Moreover, the average global temperatures are
        expected to rise by at least 1.5 degrees which could further be
        increased if timely actions are not put in place. <br />
        <br /> Despite our advancements in technological and educational fields,
        we have been quite incapable of catering to Mother Earth which has
        provided us with all her natural resources. The NITSMUN fraternity
        requests you all to stop being ignorant and become vocal advocates of
        sustainable development, by spreading awareness about the same and by
        becoming the change you seek in society. TOGETHER WE CAN, TOGETHER WE
        WILL!

    Content:"“Don’t go near the temple”, “Don’t cook or touch anything in the kitchen” and similar others are some common phrases every Indian woman gets to hear during her “that time of the month” when she is often considered “unclean”. Even in 2022, menstruation is considered a taboo, not only in India but in fact all over the world. Still today, menstruation is a period that is a reason for discrimination and exclusion for millions of girls and women. Fun fact, 28th Of May is celebrated as World Menstrual Hygiene Day as each menstrual cycle is of approximately 28 days and 5 days is the average period of menstruation. Fascinating right? This day was initiated by a german-based NGO WASH UNITED under UNICEF in 2014 to break social stigmas, educate women, provide moral support, and develop more hygienic facilities in developing countries. Every year, UNICEF conducts campaigns, donates sanitary products, and intends to innovate, create awareness, and find solutions to the daily challenges faced by menstruators. MHD’s theme this year is “To create a world where no women or girl is held back because they menstruate, by 2030” and it's all about breaking stigmas on menstruation all over the world. It aims to make that 15-year-old girl more confident about who she is, to make that 30-year-old working mother feel unashamed to share her feelings, to stop those people who think menstrual onset is a time to get her married, to stop those widening eyes when they hear “that” word, to make the word menstruation a normal rather than a secretive shame. Today, NITSMUN stands holding hands with all the menstruators in the world, recalling that chapter which we studied back in eighth grade as an explanation of a normal phenomenon and wishes them a Happy World’s Menstrual Hygiene Day!",

Starting from the era of telegrams, telephones, and televisions to a small rectangle-shaped device that contains the whole world, we’ve come a long way. Since 1969, 17 may is marked as the day of the singing of the first International Telegraph Convention(ITC) and the creation of the International Telecommunication Union(ITU). The General Assembly adopted a resolution (A/RES/60/252) in March 2006 stipulating that World Information Society Day (WISTD) shall be celebrated every year on 17 May. On this day, the world is brought together with new innovations and ideas to enhance communication around the globe. Various programs and meetings are arranged to discuss the ongoing issues and develop more connections and eradicate the digital divide, inequality between the countries. And this union aims towards highlighting and working on major issues like these to bring people together. The past three years have brought many challenges including the need of accelerating digital transformation and retrieve information globally. The covid-19 pandemic taught us how to stay close to our loved ones even when they are far away. Every year, the day is celebrated under a particular theme, and this year it is - Digital Technologies For Older Persons And Healthy Ageing. This year’s theme emphasizes the use of information technologies and their importance to stay healthy, connected, and independent on a physical, emotional, and financial level. Today, NITSMUN recognizes this initiative taken by the United Nations and celebrates the internet and this feeling of being blessed by the technology around us as a whole and as a way of living.",

    Content:"The Second World War started when Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler decided to attack Poland, in 1939. It has been the worst conflict in human history killing at least 40 to 50 million people. The Second World War resulted in the death of 5.8 million people from Poland, which was 20% of Poland's pre-war population. Homes destroyed, industries uprooted, cities deserted, the Second World War brought a wave of destruction which eventually ended with the surrender of Imperial Japan after nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On 8th May 1945, Nazi Germany officially surrendered unconditionally to the allied forces. Therefore, to commemorate all the victims of the Second World War, the UN General Assembly, by resolution 64/257, invited all member states to observe 8th and 9th May as a day to pay tribute to all the lives lost during the Second World War. With the ongoing tensions in the world, it becomes more important for us to understand what destruction a massive conflict like this can bring to humanity. Therefore, NITSMUN today takes this chance to remember all the lives lost during the Second World War and promote the UN motto 'Peace, dignity and equality on a healthy planet'."

Since then, May 3, the anniversary of the Declaration of Windhoek has been celebrated worldwide as World Press Freedom Day. May 3 acts as a reminder to governments of the need to respect their commitment to press freedom and is also a day of reflection among media professionals about issues of press freedom and professional ethics. This year on 2-5 May 2022, UNESCO and the Republic of Uruguay will host the annual World Press Freedom Day Global Conference in a hybrid format in Punta Del Este, Uruguay. Under the theme “Journalism under Digital Siege”, the digital era’s impact on freedom of expression, the safety of journalists, access to information and privacy will be discussed. Journalists and media workers are increasingly facing physical and verbal abuse, threats and intimidation, lawsuits and imprisonment to silence them. Online sexual harassment of female journalists has increased exponentially. Anti-media rhetoric, repeatedly used by some politicians and government leaders, undermines freedom of speech and puts individual journalists at risk. This year NITSMUN takes this chance and opportunity to raise awareness of the fact that for humanity’s well-being, accurate information is a public good and to fully honour the courage of journalists to inform the public, we must ensure that their rights are respected, protected and met.",

With the advent of new technologies and production processes, workers are more prone to emerging occupational risks. As per the UN, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a strong OSH (Occupational Safety and Health) system was seen, which included meaningful participation of governments, employers, workers and all relevant stakeholders which proved crucial in protecting work environments. We need to focus on building a positive OSH culture which can be achieved through inclusion and open communication between all relevant parties. As we continue to live through a global health crisis and ongoing OSH risks in the world of work, we must continue to work towards building a strong safety and health culture at all levels.",

We are in a dreadful period where revolts occur capriciously. The dreads of Afghanistan, Israel-Palestine, Russia-Ukraine show us the essential need of truce through talks. The increasing vigour in nuclear and destructive weapons should also be monitored and controlled by the member states.

Moreover, the average global temperatures are expected to rise by at least 1.5 degrees which could further be increased if timely actions are not put in place. Despite our advancements in technological and educational fields, we have been quite incapable of catering to Mother Earth which has provided us with all her natural resources. The NITSMUN fraternity requests you all to stop being ignorant and become vocal advocates of sustainable development, by spreading awareness about the same and by becoming the change you seek in society. TOGETHER WE CAN, TOGETHER WE WILL!",

    Title: "World Health Day",
    Alt:"World Health Day",
    Date:"Posted on: 7th April 2022",
    Content:"“Health is one's greatest possession”. We live in a world that moves at a tremendous speed. Since the invention of Internet, the world has greatly shrunk and individuals are now linked 24 hours a day, seven days a week. As we attempt to fulfill every commitment of our life, we often forget to take care of ourselves in the midst of this battle. The stress levels continue to rise until a huge collapse occurs, causing us to realise that in all of our frantic activity, we have neglected to take care of one precious aspect of our lives: our health. Every year on April 7, the World Health Organization (WHO) chooses a contemporary wellness or medical issue to promote. This day sets the platform for what's to come on the global stage, with topics ranging from mental health aspects to insurance and everything in between. It provides a global opportunity to focus attention on important public health issues that affect the international community. It was first observed on 22th of July 1949, but the date was later changed to 7th of April, the establishment of WHO (World Health Organization). Since 1950, the Worth Health Day uses a different theme each year selected by the current WHO Director-General, based on the suggestions of the member governments and staff. On this occasion promotional programs are launched that continue for a long time after April 7. On World Health Day 2022, WHO will focus global attention on urgent actions needed to keep humans and the planet healthy and foster a movement to create societies focused on well-being. Good health is more than just the absence of disease; it is a reflection of a community's social and mental well-being. As a result, changes in a community should seek not only to reduce sickness, but also to reduce social tensions and mental ill-health to acceptable levels in order to meet the goal of providing health for everyone. Thus NITSMUN urges everyone to aim for a healthy lifestyle and act on this year's theme to put a step closer towards everyone's health and well-being.",
